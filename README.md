# CurrencyExchange

> A node.js based backend service aimming at providing currency exchange functionality.


### Requirements:
+[x] Create Node.js API

+[ ] Setup docker container
+[ ] Deploy Node.js code on a server, any server.
+[ ] Bonus: add another route that accepts the base as a query parameter. I.e api.com/CAD?base=USD **(Ps: I assume this endpoint reflect a one-to-one relation, that is, we only consider rates between two currencies)**
